  <p>Cedeless is the personal project site of Reuben Dalke. That’s me. Hi.</p>
<p>This isn’t a <a href="https://reubendalke.com/resume/">résumé site</a>, but it exists in public largely to demonstrate my ability to build web pages. If I didn’t need to appeal to potential employers, all this stuff would be running on <code>localhost</code>.</p>
<h2>Who do you think you are, <a href="https://achewood.com/2004/02/18/title.html">putting on such airs</a>?</h2>
<p>I’m a human who appreciates video games, peanut butter, and websites that let the back button do its job. I like watching ice hockey, but it stresses me out. I go for long walks, during which I concoct new things to worry about and try to let go of old ones. I like to read, mainly fiction.</p>
<p>I don’t do social media, so this is where I exist online. If you want to talk, you can <a href="mailto:mail@cedeless.com">send me email</a>.</p>
<h2>OK, but ‘cedeless’?</h2>
<p>As origin stories go, this one is pedestrian: I bought a bag of seedless lemons once that was labeled in both English and French. I saw the C in <em>citrons</em> out of the corner of my eye and thought for a moment they’d somehow misspelled “seedless”. “Ceedless” led to “cedeless”, and within an hour I was registering a domain name.</p>
<p>I like this kind of homonym play. It’s not <em>funny</em>, exactly, but I think it’s fun. “Cedeless” doesn’t really mean anything.</p>
<p>Except…</p>
<p>I do think “cede less” kind of describes my approach to personal projects. I don’t like shortcuts. I don’t like frameworks. I want to make things myself, without relying too much on someone else’s work.</p>
<p>I’m not writing my own web server, and I’m unlikely to, say, fell a tree myself for a woodworking project. I’m not inventing the universe so I can make an apple pie. But, when practical, I’m going to roll my own stuff rather than implement someone else’s. I want to cede less control of my projects to platforms, services, and packages.</p>
<h2>What is Infinite, Worthless Time?</h2>
<p><a href="/iwt/">Infinite, Worthless Time</a> is a blog. There’s not a ton I want to share with the internet, but what I do have is there.</p>
<p>Blogs and content sites are good personal web development projects, because they encourage you to build a system that can gracefully handle arbitrary input. Did you handle the case where a post starts with a <code>ul</code>? Does your pagination scheme make sense when there are only five posts? It’s more interesting than a static brochure site, even if the content is <a href="/iwt/2023/11/29/avalanche-numbers/">less than profound</a>.</p>
<h2>What is Shelf?</h2>
<p><a href="/shelf/">Shelf</a> is a tool for keeping track of my video game library. I have an Airtable base that performs this function admirably, but I wanted to try my hand at creating something on my own.</p>
<p>Shelf is a simple table with <a href="https://github.com/dalke/Cedeless/blob/main/shelf.html">a surprising degree of underlying complexity</a>. I have plans to make it more than that, but progress is slow.</p>
<p>Keeping track of my games is something <a href="shelf/">I think about a lot</a>.</p>
<h2>So did Copilot make all this or what?</h2>
<p>Nope. I did not use any large-language-model tools in the development of this site, at least not directly or intentionally.</p>
<h2>A colophon of sorts</h2>
<!-- TODO: Update below per migration to Eleventy -->
<p>This site is powered by a local installation of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll parses Markdown, compiles Sass, processes control-flow blocks, and produces a directory of HTML, CSS, and JS files that I basically just FTP to a server.</p>
<p>I’m using Matthew Butterick’s <a href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/valkyrie/">Valkyrie</a> and <a href="https://mbtype.com/fonts/triplicate/">Triplicate</a> typefaces.</p>
<p>Colors are derived from <a href="https://www.presentandcorrect.com/blogs/blog/rams-palette">these Dieter Rams palettes</a> collected by Chad Ashley.</p>
<h2>Theme control</h2>
<p>By default, this site will match your operating system’s theme. You can override that behavior here. The setting is stored in your browser’s local storage.</p>
