    <h2>The Trades of Mikko Rantanen</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="post-body">
    <p>On Jan. 24, the Colorado Avalanche traded Mikko Rantanen to the Carolina Hurricanes for Martin Necas and Jack Drury. This was a big deal.</p>
<p>Rantanen was Colorado’s first-round pick in the 2015 draft. He scored 104 points in 2023–24, 105 in 2022–23 (including 55 goals), and won the Stanley Cup in 2021–22. He was a home-grown member of Colorado’s high-flying and -scoring first line, an alternate captain, and a fan favorite.</p>
<p>Teams usually don’t trade players like Rantanen, especially while their championship windows are open. But his contract was due to expire at the end of this season, and he was looking for a raise. Not just a raise, actually, but a big one: post-trade reports said he wanted something similar to Edmonton Oilers center Leon Draisaitl’s new contract, the NHL’s richest: eight years, $14 million average annual value. In the <a href="https://overcast.fm/+Lb2WNWy4A/4:29">Jan. 27 episode of his 32 Thoughts podcast</a>, Elliotte Friedman said Colorado’s final offer was likely 8 ✕ $11.75M. That would have made Rantanen the league’s highest-paid <em>winger</em>[^1], but also would have kept him below Colorado’s self-imposed ceiling: Nathan MacKinnon’s $12.6M. Rantanen’s camp said no, Colorado’s front office concluded they weren’t going to get the numbers to work, and thusly did come the <s>bus</s> trade.</p>
<p>Everyone outside Colorado’s front office was, as Friedman put it, stunned. Rantanen held out the last time he was due a new contract, waiting until after training camp started to sign the 8 ✕ $9.25M that’s ending after this season.</p>
<p>[^1]: Center is considered a more valuable position than wing. Artemi Panarin ($11.6M) is currently the league’s highest-paid winger.</p>
