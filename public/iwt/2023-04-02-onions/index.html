    <h2>Onions</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="post-body">
    <p>I complained to S. yesterday that our lawn was looking rough. Mowing now would be a disservice to the pollinators that are enjoying the deadnettle, so she suggested I could express my desire for order by working to remove the volunteer green onions. These onions grow in clumps, and create long green manes of savory-smelling &quot;grass&quot;.</p>
<p>She'd seen advice recently that the best way to get rid of these onions was to use a spade to cut down and under them, pull the layer of soil back to expose the bulbs, then pull each onion by its bulb &quot;down&quot; through the soil. Sort of like hair plugs in reverse. I don't really know anything about hair plugs.</p>
<p>I worked on a couple small patches for maybe 45 minutes, ended up with a pile of tiny white bulbs and long green ... stems? ... and made pretty much zero difference in the aesthetics of our lawn.</p>
<p>S. observed that men aren't interested in weeding, only in mowing, and I guess that's true in my case. I have very little enthusiasm for gardening, and only slightly more for lawn care. My primary interest in mowing the lawn is making it look tidy, a goal that's often in direct opposition to S.'s. I don't need the lawn to be a sterile monoculture of Bermuda grass or whatever, but a part of me <em>does</em> need my stuff to present an acceptable face to the world, to look intentional.</p>
<p>I might come back to the Onion Project, if only to work on my gardening muscles a little bit. The onion bulbs, packed together as they are, remind me of spider eggs, which kinda grosses me out.</p>
