    <h2>The most memorable Colorado Avalanche player to wear each roster number</h2>
  </header>
  <div class="post-body">
    <p>The 2023–24 NHL season is about one-quarter complete. There are quite a few new players on this season's Avalanche roster, but I've watched enough of their games that I've pretty much stopped needing to look up who wears which number. Doing so earlier in the season, though, got me to thinking about which player I most associate with each sweater number. So I've compiled a list.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this list, I'm ignoring the franchise's years in Quebec. I'm more than happy to wear a Nordiques logo in public, but I didn't pay attention to the team until they moved to Denver.</p>
<p>I've mostly pulled this stuff out of my own head, of course, but for less well-known numbers, I consulted <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/COL/numbers.html">Hockey Reference</a>.</p>
<h3>#1: Semyon Varlamov</h3>
<p>The first starting goaltender to achieve sustained success with the Avalanche in the post-Patrick Roy era.</p>
<h3>#2: Sylvain Lefebvre</h3>
<p>Defensemen on the 1996 Cup team.</p>
<h3>#3: Aaron Miller</h3>
<p>Defensemen on the 1996 Cup team. Was traded in 2001 to LA in the deal that brought Rob Blake to Colorado.</p>
<h3>#4: Bowen Byram</h3>
<p>This is definitely recency bias. A lot of notable people have worn #4 for the Avs: Uwe Krupp, who scored the Cup-winning goal in triple overtime in 1996; Blake, who was on the 2001 Cup team; John-Michael Liles, who until recently held a ton of the team's offense-by-defensemen records; and Tyson Barrie, who was part of the transition from the doldrums of the early-to-mid 2010s to the success of recent years, and was traded to Toronto in 2019 for Nazem Kadri.</p>
<p>But Byram was on the 2022 Cup team, and is the first name I think of in relation to #4.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Rob Blake</p>
<h3>#5: Brett Clark</h3>
<p>Not a ton to choose from here, but Clark was a pretty solid defenseman for a few seasons.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Alexei Gusarov, defensemen on the 1996 Cup team</p>
<h3>#6: Erik Johnson</h3>
<p>First overall draft pick by the St. Louis Blues, traded to the Avalanche in 2011 for Chris Stewart in a deal I didn't like, stuck it out through the lean years, and won a Cup with the Avs in 2022. Deserves a warm reception when his Sabres play in Denver on Dec. 13.</p>
<h3>#7: Devon Toews</h3>
<p>More recency bias. The other reasonable options are Curtis Leschyshyn (1996 Cup team) and Greg de Vries (2001 Cup team). But I had to look up those guys to confirm my recollection that they both wore #7. Didn't have to do that for Toews.</p>
<h3>#8: Cale Makar</h3>
<p>This is an easy one, but Sandis Ozoliņš was a big deal in the team's early years in Colorado, and Teemu Salänne wore #8 his one year on the Avs.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Sandis Ozoliņš.</p>
<h3>#9: Matt Duchene</h3>
<p>Remember when the Avs had Duchene, Paul Stastny, and Ryan O'Reilly down the middle? Then they all left, and <em>then</em> the Avs got good. Duchene's trade helped a lot with that last bit.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Mike Ricci (one third of the Yelle-Ricci-Keane line from the 1996 Cup run)</p>
<h3>#10: Sven Andrighetto</h3>
<p>Slim pickings here. #10 doesn't ring <em>any</em> bells for me, frankly. But Andrighetto is relatively recent.</p>
<h3>#11: Andrew Cogliano</h3>
<p>Key depth acquisition during the 2022 Cup run. He was the Avs' &quot;old guy without a Cup&quot;, and every successful team needs one of those.</p>
<h3>#12: Jarome Iginla</h3>
<p>Yeah, Iginla played for the Avs. Led the team in scoring in 2014–15. Was traded to LA in 2017 for a conditional fourth-round pick. Whatever the condition was, it wasn't met, so the Avs ultimately traded him for literally nothing.</p>
<h3>#13: Valeri Nichushkin</h3>
<p>Has been a wildly successful reclamation project for the Avalanche. Key part of the 2022 Cup team.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Valeri Kamensky, a big part of the 1996 Cup team</p>
<h3>#14: Theo Fleury</h3>
<p>#14 is another number I don't have an immediate association with, though there are a few name on the Hockey Reference list I have good memories of: Dave Reid was a nice depth piece on the 2001 Cup team, Ian Laperrière was a fan favorite for a few years, and Blake Comeau did that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi_eGSHViNM">&quot;drop-pass on a breakaway&quot; thing</a> during the wretched 2016-17 season.</p>
<p>Fleury was one of those Pierre Lacroix trade-deadline acquisitions that made a big splash without accomplishing much. He played well in Colorado, though: 24 points in 15 regular-season games, 17 more in 18 playoff games. Avs lost to Dallas in the conference finals. The summer of 1999 sucked.</p>
<h3>#15: P.A. Parenteau</h3>
<p>The most recent &quot;high-profile&quot; player to wear #15 for the Avs. I'd prefer Andrew Brunette, but my memory does what it does.</p>
<h3>#16: Nikita Zadorov</h3>
<p>Came over from Buffalo in the Ryan O'Reilly trade, along with eventual Cup-winner J.T. Compher. Didn't win anything while in Colorado, but people liked when he laid big hits. Was traded to Chicago for Brandon Saad.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Nicolas Aubé-Kubel, 2022 Cup-winner (and <a href="https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/2410180">-denter</a>)</p>
<h3>#17: Tyson Jost</h3>
<p>A first-round pick who never quite found it in Colorado. Was traded in 2022 to Minnesota for Nico Sturm. Sucks to be the guy traded away from the team that goes on to win the Cup.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Jari Kurri(!)</p>
<h3>#18: Adam Deadmarsh</h3>
<p>Part of the 1996 Cup team. I was new to hockey in 1996, blessed with a team that arrived in my area ready to compete for a Stanley Cup. The names of (almost) everyone on that team will live in my head forever.</p>
<p>Deadmarsh had his name misspelled on the Cup (&quot;Deadmarch&quot;), and was traded to LA in 2001 (along with Aaron Miller and draft picks) for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht.</p>
<p>#18 is a bit of a strange number in Avalanche Land. It's been worn by a number of noteworthy players, but it's not the number those players are known for: Alex Tanguay (better known as #40), Chris Drury (who switched from #37 and then was immediately traded), Stéphane Yelle (notable to me, at least; he wore #26 during his first stint with the Avs, but Paul Stastny had it when Yelle returned to the team in 2010). Most recently worn by Alex Newhook, who was on the 2022 Cup team, but was offloaded to the Canadiens this past summer.</p>
<h3>#19: Joe Sakic</h3>
<p>Duh.</p>
<h3>#20: René Corbet</h3>
<p>1996 Cup team.</p>
<h3>#21: Peter Forsberg</h3>
<p>Another easy one.</p>
<p>It probably says something about my personality that one of my enduring Peter Forsberg memories is that he ended his comeback attempt and retired for good on February 14, 2011. The Avs lost 9-1 to Calgary that night. The Valentine's Day Massacre. Why remember cool stuff when you can remember painful stuff?</p>
<h3>#22: Claude Lemieux</h3>
<p>1996 Cup team. His dirty hit on Kris Draper during the conference finals that year ignited the whole Avalanche–Red Wings acrimony.</p>
<h3>#23: Milan Hejduk</h3>
<p>Easy.</p>
<h3>#24: Jon Klemm</h3>
<p>Steady defenseman on the 1996 and 2001 Cup teams.</p>
<h3>#25: Chris Stewart</h3>
<p>Stewart was an up-and-coming power forward in 2009–10. Early the next season, he broke his hand in a fight. Three months later, he was traded to St. Louis in the Erik Johnson deal. I liked Stewart, so I didn't like that trade. But it worked out well for the Avalanche.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Logan O'Connor should be the #25 I remember. More recent and more important to the team's success, at least directly.</p>
<h3>#26: Paul Stastny</h3>
<p>The Avs didn't achieve anything while he was in Colorado, but it sure sucked when he walked.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Stéphane Yelle</p>
<h3>#27: Jonathan Drouin</h3>
<p>I couldn't remember anyone else who wore #27 until I looked it up. Ryan Graves was nice. Scott Parker stuck around for a long time (1999–08), but enforcers generally aren't my favorite players.</p>
<h3>#28: Eric Lacroix</h3>
<p>Son of longtime GM Pierre Lacroix. I remember him being OK in the years between the first two Cups.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Steven Reinprecht, who was on the 2001 Cup team</p>
<h3>#29: Nathan MacKinnon</h3>
<p>A cornerstone of the current team. Pretty easy.</p>
<p>The only other #29 I can remember is Éric Messier, who was on the 2001 Cup team.</p>
<h3>#30: Marc Denis</h3>
<p>Patrick Roy's backup for a while.</p>
<h3>#31: Peter Budaj</h3>
<p>A capable-enough goaltender through some of the dark years.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> Phillip Grubauer</p>
<h3>#32: François Beauchemin</h3>
<p>I guess? I might remember Riku Hahl wearing #32 &quot;better&quot; than I do Beauchemin, but both are pretty fuzzy.</p>
<h3>#33: Patrick Roy</h3>
<p>Still has his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfe_q-Y0cBM">Stanley Cup rings in his ears</a>.</p>
<h3>#34: Carl Söderberg</h3>
<p>&quot;Big ol' Carl&quot; had some decent years in Colorado.</p>
<h3>#35: Darcy Kuemper</h3>
<p>Winning a Cup &gt;&gt;&gt; being around longer than one season.</p>
<h3>#36: Steve Moore</h3>
<p>Really, I don't remember <em>anyone</em> wearing #36. But Steve Moore did. And Steve Moore is notable for getting attacked by Todd Bertuzzi in retaliation for injuring Markus Naslund. I don't want to recap the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bertuzzi%E2%80%93Steve_Moore_incident">Bertuzzi–Moore incident</a> here. It's the kind of thing that makes me embarrassed to like hockey.</p>
<h3>#37: Chris Drury</h3>
<p>Chris Drury was so rad in the 2001 Cup run. He was my favorite player, in that &quot;good but not the biggest star on the team&quot; way. Until 2022, I was sort of convinced that trading Drury in 2002 had cursed the Avalanche to never win another Cup.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">Runner-up:</span> J.T. Compher</p>
<h3>#38: Matthew Barnaby</h3>
<p>I mean, no one, really, but maybe Matt Barnaby a little? Should probably be Dave Andreychuk.</p>
<h3>#39: T.J. Galiardi</h3>
<p>Apologies to Pavel Francouz, who deserves this slot far more than Galiardi does.</p>
<h3>#40: Alex Tanguay</h3>
<p>Scoring two goals in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final will make you pretty memorable. I could watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfJmtsxuU48">this one</a> forever.</p>
<p><span class="lead-in">EDIT 2024-02-28:</span> Whoops, that one's from Game 5 (says it right in the title), which the Avalanche lost 4–1. But still: slapshots on the rush are sweet.</p>
<h3>#41: Craig Anderson</h3>
<p>Anderson was in Colorado for one full season and part of another, but his Game 3 shutout of the Sharks in the 2010 quarterfinals—and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-06bXkPaQE">crowd reaction to him being named first star</a>—was pretty memorable.</p>
<h3>#42: Josh Manson</h3>
<p>Not many #42's to choose from, but Manson would be here anyway. Current player and a Cup winner in 2022.</p>
<h3>#43: Darren Helm</h3>
<p>Another chance to go with T.J. Galiardi. Or maybe Michael Sgarbossa. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9cPykH7cTw">Helm's series-winner against St. Louis</a> in 2022 is cast in bronze in my head.</p>
<h3>#44: Ryan Wilson</h3>
<p>Serviceable defensemen during the lean years.</p>
<h3>#45: Jonathan Bernier</h3>
<p>Backup goaltender in 2017–18. Got hurt in the playoffs.</p>
<h3>#46: Stefan Elliott</h3>
<p>One of two offensive defensemen (along with Tyson Barrie) who came up around the same time. I remember being more excited about Elliott than Barrie. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z7CnAaKF6U">Scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game</a>.</p>
<h3>#47: No one</h3>
<p>Alex Galchenyuk most recently. Otherwise it's Dominic Toninato or Ray Macias.</p>
<h3>#48: Scott Young</h3>
<p>1996 Cup team</p>
<h3>#49: Samuel Girard</h3>
<p>2022 Cup team and current player. Hope he's doing well.</p>
<h3>#50: Ivan Prosvetov</h3>
<p>Current back-up goaltender.</p>
<h3>#51: Andrei Kovalenko</h3>
<p>Just kidding. I have no memory of Kovalenko in the Avs uniform. He was part of the trade that brought Patrick Roy to Colorado.</p>
<h3>#52: Adam Foote</h3>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<h3>#53: Derek Morris</h3>
<p>The primary return in the Chris Drury trade, so of course I wasn't a fan.</p>
<h3>#54: David Jones</h3>
<p>Scored a few goals during the lean years.</p>
<h3>#55: Cody McLeod</h3>
<p>The Highlander. Fan favorite.</p>
<h3>#56: Kurtis MacDermid</h3>
<p>Current player. 2022 Cup team.</p>
<h3>#57: Gabriel Bourque</h3>
<p>I don't remember Bourque doing much of anything other than wearing #57.</p>
<h3>#58: Patrick Bordeleau</h3>
<p>Enforcer-type during the mid-2010s.</p>
<h3>#59: Ben Meyers</h3>
<p>Highly regarded college free agent signing who has yet to make a compelling case to stay in the NHL.</p>
<h3>#60: José Théodore</h3>
<p>A putative #1 goalie who was fine but not great as the Avs descended into mediocrity in the mid-aughts.</p>
<h3>#61: Martin Kaut</h3>
<p>Recent first-round pick who couldn't crack the NHL roster and is now out of the league.</p>
<h3>#62: Artturi Lehkonen</h3>
<p>Trade-deadline acquisition in 2022. Scored the overtime goal in Game 4 of the Conference Finals to send the Avs to the Stanley Cup Final. Scored the game-winning (and eventual Cup-winning) goal in Game 6 if the Final. Pretty good.</p>
<h3>#63: No one</h3>
<p>No, I don't remember Joel Prpic.</p>
<h3>#64: Nail Yakupov</h3>
<p>The only Avalanche player to ever wear 64. Former first overall draft pick with the Oilers. Didn't stick around long.</p>
<h3>#65–69: No one</h3>
<p>Keaton Middleton wore #67 in 2021, and Cal Burke wore #68 for the two games he played in 2022–23. Neither are memorable.</p>
<h3>#70: Sam Malinski</h3>
<p>This would be another &quot;no one&quot; if not for the games Malinksi has played in the past few days.</p>
<h3>#71: Patrice Brisebois</h3>
<p>Longtime Montreal Canadiens defenseman. Played in Colorado for two seasons before going back to Montreal.</p>
<h3>#72: Joonas Donskoi</h3>
<p>Recent depth forward. Was only with the team for two seasons before being selected by Seattle in the expansion draft. Retired this season because of lingering post-concussion symptoms.</p>
<h3>#73-76: No one</h3>
<p>Sampo Ranta wore #75 in 2022–23, but didn't stick in the NHL.</p>
<h3>#77: Ray Bourque</h3>
<p>Was a Boston Bruin for a millions years before being traded to Colorado to chase a Cup. Retired after they won in 2001.</p>
<h3>#78: Nico Sturm</h3>
<p>The only player to wear #78 for the Avalanche. 2022 trade-deadline acquisition. Assisted on a big goal in Game 4 of the Final.</p>
<h3>#79 and #80: No one</h3>
<p>No one's ever worn these numbers for the Avalanche.</p>
<h3>#81: Denis Malgin</h3>
<p>Scored a few goals last season.</p>
<h3>#82: Caleb Jones</h3>
<p>The only #82 in Avs history. Has been playing recently with Girard out.</p>
<h3>#83: Matt Nieto</h3>
<p>Long Beach native. Nice bottom-six forward.</p>
<h3>#84-86: No One</h3>
<p>More unused numbers.</p>
<h3>#87: Pierre Turgeon</h3>
<p>This list is littered with big-ish names who came to Colorado toward the end of their careers: Iginla, Fleury, Beauchemin, Brisebois, Ray Bourque, Turgeon, Ryan Smyth (plus Paul Kariya and Teemu Salänne, who aren't on this list). There's been much less of that since the institution of the salary cap, but during the Pierre Lacroix days, you could pretty much bank on someone you'd heard of signing in the offseason or arriving via trade toward the end of the season to play for a chance at the Cup.</p>
<h3>#88: Peter Mueller</h3>
<p>Looked good in Arizona in the late aughts. Traded to Colorado for Wojtek Wolski in 2010, and played well before sustaining a concussion on a hit from Rob Blake.</p>
<h3>#89: Mikkel Bødker</h3>
<p>The only option for #89. Trade-deadline rental in 2016.</p>
<h3>#90: Ryan O'Reilly</h3>
<p>Seemed like he was going to be a big part of the next good Avalanche team, but a series of contract disputes soured his relationship with the team. He was traded to Buffalo for J.T. Compher and Nikita Zadorov.</p>
<h3>#91: Nazem Kadri</h3>
<p>Was in many ways the missing piece that pushed the Avs from contenders to Cup winners. Had a terrific playoffs in 2022.</p>
<h3>#92: Gabriel Landeskog</h3>
<p>Was named captain after his rookie season and has been the soul of the team since. A knee injury has kept him from playing since Game 6 of the Final in 2022.</p>
<h3>#93: No one</h3>
<h3>#94: Ryan Smyth</h3>
<p>Longtime Oiler who bounced around a bit toward the end of his career. Actually tied (with Milan Hejduk) for the team lead in scoring in 2008–09.</p>
<h3>#95: André Burakovsky</h3>
<p>Key secondary scoring during the 2022 Cup run (and the two seasons prior).</p>
<h3>#96: Mikko Rantanen</h3>
<p>2022 Cup winner and current top-line winger. A wizard when it comes to awkward-looking one-timers. Now I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1D1l7mdgU8">this song</a> stuck in my head.</p>
<h3>#97 and #98: No one</h3>
<h3>#99: No one</h3>
<p>Wayne Gretzky's #99 is retired league-wide.</p>
