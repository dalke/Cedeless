      "content_html": "<p>As I did the previous year, I spent <em>several hours</em> in 2024 consuming media, and several more hours walking around thinking about consuming media.</p>\n<h3>Video Games</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Dave the Diver (2023)</li>\n<li>Fortnite (2017)</li>\n<li>Super Mega Baseball 4 (2023) (Abandoned)</li>\n<li>Burnout Paradise (2008) (Replay)</li>\n<li>Super Mario RPG (2023) (In progress)</li>\n<li>Remnant: From the Ashes (2019) (Abandoned)</li>\n<li>Terra Nil (2023)</li>\n<li>Destiny 2 (2017) (In progress)</li>\n<li>PowerWash Simulator (2021) (Replay)</li>\n<li>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor (2024) (Early access; in progress)</li>\n<li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (2023) (In progress)</li>\n<li>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged (2023)</li>\n<li>Diablo IV (2023) (Abandoned)</li>\n<li>Vampire Survivors (2021) (In progress)</li>\n<li>Valheim (2021) (Abandoned)</li>\n<li>Hades II (2024) (Early access; in progress)</li>\n<li>The Talos Principle (2014)</li>\n<li>Limbo (2010)</li>\n<li>Thank Goodness You’re Here!

I started a few things but didn’t finish much. Super Mario RPG, Destiny, Boltgun, PowerWash Simulator, and Vampire Survivors are all in some form of deep stasis, waiting for me to come back to DLC or overcome a stuck-in-the-mud absence of inertia. DRG: Survivor and Hades II are both really good as-is but still in early access, and I’m inclined to wait until they’re properly released to go back to them. Terra Nil was a short but satisfying exercise in putting a ruined world back together. The Talos Principle was great, and this in-game description of the titular idea has been in my thoughts a lot recently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s this old philosophical concept about the impossibility of avoiding reality—no matter what you believe, if you lose your blood, you will die. I think that applies to our situation more than we’d like to admit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Grounded is the most fun I’ve had with a tree-punching game, and Children of the Sun was a weird sniping/puzzle game that knew when to call it a day. Echoes of Wisdom was a neat idea that mostly failed to make any sort of lasting impression on me.</p>\n<p>I’ve put more than 200 hours into Satisfactory, mostly designing, building, and disassembling <em>systems</em> rather than producing parts. It’s really good, but at this pace I’ll be playing it for the rest of my life.</p>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Shift</em> (Silo #2), by Hugh Howey</li>\n<li><em>Dust</em> (Silo #3), by Hugh Howey</li>\n<li><em>To Be Taught, If Fortunate</em>, by Becky Chambers</li>\n<li><em>The Great Believers</em>, by Rebecca Makkai</li>\n<li><em>All Systems Red</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #1), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>Artificial Condition</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #2), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>Rogue Protocol</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #3), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>Exit Strategy</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #4), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>Compulsory</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #0.5), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>Home: Habitat, Range, Niche, Territory</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #4.5), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>Network Effect</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #5), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>Fugitive Telemetry</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #6), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>System Collapse</em> (The Murderbot Diaries #7), by Martha Wells</li>\n<li><em>The Black Company</em> (The Chronicles of the Black Company #1), by Glen Cook</li>\n<li><em>The Color of Magic</em> (Discworld #1), by Terry Pratchett</li>\n<li><em>The Light Fantastic</em> (Discworld #2), by Terry Pratchett</li>\n<li><em>Edges</em> (Inverted Frontier #1), by Linda Nagata</li>\n<li><em>Silver</em> (Inverted Frontier #1), by Linda Nagata</li>\n<li><em>Shards of Earth</em> (The Final Architecture #1), by Adrian Tchaikovsky</li>\n<li><em>Exhalation: Stories</em>, by Ted Chiang (Audiobook)</li>\n<li><em>This Is How You Lose the Time War</em>, by Amal El-Mohtar &amp; Max Gladstone (Audiobook)</li>\n<li><em>The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</em>, by V.E.

There’s violence, but Wells describes it sparingly and doesn’t luxuriate in it the way some other writers would. I loved the whole series.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere: Ted Chiang’s short stories are great (see yet another rewatch of Arrival below); I want to own a print version of <em>Time War</em> so I can highlight all the great wordplay; magical realism (<em>Wind-Up Bird</em>) doesn’t always hit; I’m enjoying Adrian Tchaikovsky’s Final Architecture books.</p>\n<h3>Movies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rink (2001)</li>\n<li>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)</li>\n<li>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)</li>\n<li>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)</li>\n<li>Dune (2021) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Mission: Impossible (1996) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Mission: Impossible II (2000) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Mission: Impossible III (2006) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol (2011) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015)</li>\n<li>Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Dune: Part Two (2024)</li>\n<li>Arrival (2016) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Fury (2014)</li>\n<li>Eternals (2021)</li>\n<li>U-571 (2000)</li>\n<li>Valkyrie (2008)</li>\n<li>American Sniper (2014)</li>\n<li>M*A*S*H (1970)</li>\n<li>Syriana (2005)</li>\n<li>Wonder Woman (2017) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Troy (2004)</li>\n<li>Starship Troopers (1997) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Ronin (1998) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Pearl Harbor (2001)</li>\n<li>Spy Game (2001)</li>\n<li>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)</li>\n<li>Galaxy Quest (1999) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Jack Reacher (2012) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Event Horizon (1997)</li>\n<li>Thor: Love and Thunder (2022)</li>\n<li>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)</li>\n<li>The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special (2022)</li>\n<li>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)</li>\n<li>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)</li>\n<li>Werewolf by Night (2022)</li>\n<li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)</li>\n<li>The Marvels (2023)</li>\n<li>Star Trek: Generations (1994) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Godzilla Minus One (2023)</li>\n<li>Heat (1995) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Drop Dead Gorgeous (1999)</li>\n<li>Sneakers (1992) (Rewatch)</li>\n<li>Wolfs (2024)</li>\n<li>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine (2024)</li>\n<li>Safe House (2012)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I continued to traverse the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2024, but the stuff that stuck with me is in the next section. I saw Dune 2 and Furiosa in the theater and enjoyed both. The Lord of the Rings movies were such meme factories that they’re difficult to take seriously today. I thought I’d missed more of the Mission: Impossible movies than I had, and I don’t ever need to see #2 again. I still love Arrival.

I spent about 300 hours on it over three months. It’s a very solid second pass on Breath of the Wild: same map, better abilities, <em>much</em> better dungeons, a bunch more clever shrines.</p>\n<p>Hi-Fi Rush, Cocoon, Mario Wonder, and Chants of Sennaar are also great. Terra Nil and SteamWorld Build are good. I probably would have liked Dave the Diver more if I hadn’t played it while sick and feverish.</p>\n<p>Burning Shores didn’t bring anything new to Horizon except some additional story that I found unexpectedly touching. Tinykin was probably my favorite “old” game I played this year, excluding all-time favorites like Link to the Past and Burnout Paradise.</p>\n<h3>Books</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Master of Furies</em> (The Firemane Saga #3), by Raymond E.

There’s some fun stuff in there, and I can see why people enjoyed it so much. Of the stuff I hadn’t seen, I think the end of Infinity War hit me the hardest.</p>\n<p>Other than that I was mostly watching or <em>rewatching</em> mindless stuff while riding a stationary bike. Oppenheimer was my favorite movie of the the year by default. I liked it well enough.</p>\n<h3>TV</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reservations Dogs (S1 and S2)</li>\n<li>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</li>\n<li>For All Mankind (S1-3)</li>\n<li>Dead to Me</li>\n<li>Only Murders in the Building (S1 and S2)</li>\n<li>Russian Doll (S2)</li>\n<li>Brooklyn 99</li>\n<li>Ted Lasso (S3)</li>\n<li>I Am Groot</li>\n<li>What We Do in the Shadows (S5)</li>\n<li>Reservation Dogs (S3)</li>\n<li>Loki</li>\n<li>Only Murders in the Building (S3)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Reservation Dogs was great.

      "title": "The most memorable Colorado Avalanche player to wear each roster number",
      "content_html": "<p>The 2023–24 NHL season is about one-quarter complete. There are quite a few new players on this season’s Avalanche roster, but I’ve watched enough of their games that I’ve pretty much stopped needing to look up who wears which number. Doing so earlier in the season, though, got me to thinking about which player I most associate with each sweater number. So I’ve compiled a list.</p>\n<p>For the purposes of this list, I’m ignoring the franchise’s years in Quebec. I’m more than happy to wear a Nordiques logo in public, but I didn’t pay attention to the team until they moved to Denver.</p>\n<p>I’ve mostly pulled this stuff out of my own head, of course, but for less well-known numbers, I consulted <a href=\"https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/COL/numbers.html\">Hockey Reference</a>.</p>\n<h3>#1: Semyon Varlamov</h3>\n<p>The first starting goaltender to achieve sustained success with the Avalanche in the post-Patrick Roy era.</p>\n<h3>#2: Sylvain Lefebvre</h3>\n<p>Defensemen on the 1996 Cup team.</p>\n<h3>#3: Aaron Miller</h3>\n<p>Defensemen on the 1996 Cup team. Was traded in 2001 to LA in the deal that brought Rob Blake to Colorado.</p>\n<h3>#4: Bowen Byram</h3>\n<p>This is definitely recency bias. A lot of notable people have worn #4 for the Avs: Uwe Krupp, who scored the Cup-winning goal in triple overtime in 1996; Blake, who was on the 2001 Cup team; John-Michael Liles, who until recently held a ton of the team’s offense-by-defensemen records; and Tyson Barrie, who was part of the transition from the doldrums of the early-to-mid 2010s to the success of recent years, and was traded to Toronto in 2019 for Nazem Kadri.</p>\n<p>But Byram was on the 2022 Cup team, and is the first name I think of in relation to #4.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Rob Blake</p>\n<h3>#5: Brett Clark</h3>\n<p>Not a ton to choose from here, but Clark was a pretty solid defenseman for a few seasons.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Alexei Gusarov, defensemen on the 1996 Cup team</p>\n<h3>#6: Erik Johnson</h3>\n<p>First overall draft pick by the St. Louis Blues, traded to the Avalanche in 2011 for Chris Stewart in a deal I didn’t like, stuck it out through the lean years, and won a Cup with the Avs in 2022. Deserves a warm reception when his Sabres play in Denver on Dec. 13.</p>\n<h3>#7: Devon Toews</h3>\n<p>More recency bias. The other reasonable options are Curtis Leschyshyn (1996 Cup team) and Greg de Vries (2001 Cup team). But I had to look up those guys to confirm my recollection that they both wore #7. Didn’t have to do that for Toews.</p>\n<h3>#8: Cale Makar</h3>\n<p>This is an easy one, but Sandis Ozoliņš was a big deal in the team’s early years in Colorado, and Teemu Salänne wore #8 his one year on the Avs.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Sandis Ozoliņš.</p>\n<h3>#9: Matt Duchene</h3>\n<p>Remember when the Avs had Duchene, Paul Stastny, and Ryan O’Reilly down the middle? Then they all left, and <em>then</em> the Avs got good. Duchene’s trade helped a lot with that last bit.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Mike Ricci (one third of the Yelle-Ricci-Keane line from the 1996 Cup run)</p>\n<h3>#10: Sven Andrighetto</h3>\n<p>Slim pickings here. #10 doesn’t ring <em>any</em> bells for me, frankly. But Andrighetto is relatively recent.</p>\n<h3>#11: Andrew Cogliano</h3>\n<p>Key depth acquisition during the 2022 Cup run. He was the Avs’ “old guy without a Cup”, and every successful team needs one of those.</p>\n<h3>#12: Jarome Iginla</h3>\n<p>Yeah, Iginla played for the Avs. Led the team in scoring in 2014–15. Was traded to LA in 2017 for a conditional fourth-round pick. Whatever the condition was, it wasn’t met, so the Avs ultimately traded him for literally nothing.</p>\n<h3>#13: Valeri Nichushkin</h3>\n<p>Has been a wildly successful reclamation project for the Avalanche. Key part of the 2022 Cup team.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Valeri Kamensky, a big part of the 1996 Cup team</p>\n<h3>#14: Theo Fleury</h3>\n<p>#14 is another number I don’t have an immediate association with, though there are a few name on the Hockey Reference list I have good memories of: Dave Reid was a nice depth piece on the 2001 Cup team, Ian Laperrière was a fan favorite for a few years, and Blake Comeau did that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi_eGSHViNM\">“drop-pass on a breakaway” thing</a> during the wretched 2016-17 season.</p>\n<p>Fleury was one of those Pierre Lacroix trade-deadline acquisitions that made a big splash without accomplishing much. He played well in Colorado, though: 24 points in 15 regular-season games, 17 more in 18 playoff games. Avs lost to Dallas in the conference finals. The summer of 1999 sucked.</p>\n<h3>#15: P.A. Parenteau</h3>\n<p>The most recent “high-profile” player to wear #15 for the Avs. I’d prefer Andrew Brunette, but my memory does what it does.</p>\n<h3>#16: Nikita Zadorov</h3>\n<p>Came over from Buffalo in the Ryan O’Reilly trade, along with eventual Cup-winner J.T. Compher. Didn’t win anything while in Colorado, but people liked when he laid big hits. Was traded to Chicago for Brandon Saad.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Nicolas Aubé-Kubel, 2022 Cup-winner (and <a href=\"https://www.thescore.com/nhl/news/2410180\">-denter</a>)</p>\n<h3>#17: Tyson Jost</h3>\n<p>A first-round pick who never quite found it in Colorado. Was traded in 2022 to Minnesota for Nico Sturm. Sucks to be the guy traded away from the team that goes on to win the Cup.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Jari Kurri(!)</p>\n<h3>#18: Adam Deadmarsh</h3>\n<p>Part of the 1996 Cup team. I was new to hockey in 1996, blessed with a team that arrived in my area ready to compete for a Stanley Cup. The names of (almost) everyone on that team will live in my head forever.</p>\n<p>Deadmarsh had his name misspelled on the Cup (“Deadmarch”), and was traded to LA in 2001 (along with Aaron Miller and draft picks) for Rob Blake and Steven Reinprecht.</p>\n<p>#18 is a bit of a strange number in Avalanche Land. It’s been worn by a number of noteworthy players, but it’s not the number those players are known for: Alex Tanguay (better known as #40), Chris Drury (who switched from #37 and then was immediately traded), Stéphane Yelle (notable to me, at least; he wore #26 during his first stint with the Avs, but Paul Stastny had it when Yelle returned to the team in 2010). Most recently worn by Alex Newhook, who was on the 2022 Cup team, but was offloaded to the Canadiens this past summer.</p>\n<h3>#19: Joe Sakic</h3>\n<p>Duh.</p>\n<h3>#20: René Corbet</h3>\n<p>1996 Cup team.</p>\n<h3>#21: Peter Forsberg</h3>\n<p>Another easy one.</p>\n<p>It probably says something about my personality that one of my enduring Peter Forsberg memories is that he ended his comeback attempt and retired for good on February 14, 2011. The Avs lost 9-1 to Calgary that night. The Valentine’s Day Massacre. Why remember cool stuff when you can remember painful stuff?</p>\n<h3>#22: Claude Lemieux</h3>\n<p>1996 Cup team. His dirty hit on Kris Draper during the conference finals that year ignited the whole Avalanche–Red Wings acrimony.</p>\n<h3>#23: Milan Hejduk</h3>\n<p>Easy.</p>\n<h3>#24: Jon Klemm</h3>\n<p>Steady defenseman on the 1996 and 2001 Cup teams.</p>\n<h3>#25: Chris Stewart</h3>\n<p>Stewart was an up-and-coming power forward in 2009–10. Early the next season, he broke his hand in a fight. Three months later, he was traded to St. Louis in the Erik Johnson deal. I liked Stewart, so I didn’t like that trade. But it worked out well for the Avalanche.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Logan O’Connor should be the #25 I remember. More recent and more important to the team’s success, at least directly.</p>\n<h3>#26: Paul Stastny</h3>\n<p>The Avs didn’t achieve anything while he was in Colorado, but it sure sucked when he walked.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Stéphane Yelle</p>\n<h3>#27: Jonathan Drouin</h3>\n<p>I couldn’t remember anyone else who wore #27 until I looked it up. Ryan Graves was nice. Scott Parker stuck around for a long time (1999–08), but enforcers generally aren’t my favorite players.</p>\n<h3>#28: Eric Lacroix</h3>\n<p>Son of longtime GM Pierre Lacroix. I remember him being OK in the years between the first two Cups.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Steven Reinprecht, who was on the 2001 Cup team</p>\n<h3>#29: Nathan MacKinnon</h3>\n<p>A cornerstone of the current team. Pretty easy.</p>\n<p>The only other #29 I can remember is Éric Messier, who was on the 2001 Cup team.</p>\n<h3>#30: Marc Denis</h3>\n<p>Patrick Roy’s backup for a while.</p>\n<h3>#31: Peter Budaj</h3>\n<p>A capable-enough goaltender through some of the dark years.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> Phillip Grubauer</p>\n<h3>#32: François Beauchemin</h3>\n<p>I guess? I might remember Riku Hahl wearing #32 “better” than I do Beauchemin, but both are pretty fuzzy.</p>\n<h3>#33: Patrick Roy</h3>\n<p>Still has his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rfe_q-Y0cBM\">Stanley Cup rings in his ears</a>.</p>\n<h3>#34: Carl Söderberg</h3>\n<p>“Big ol’ Carl” had some decent years in Colorado.</p>\n<h3>#35: Darcy Kuemper</h3>\n<p>Winning a Cup &gt;&gt;&gt; being around longer than one season.</p>\n<h3>#36: Steve Moore</h3>\n<p>Really, I don’t remember <em>anyone</em> wearing #36. But Steve Moore did. And Steve Moore is notable for getting attacked by Todd Bertuzzi in retaliation for injuring Markus Naslund. I don’t want to recap the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bertuzzi%E2%80%93Steve_Moore_incident\">Bertuzzi–Moore incident</a> here. It’s the kind of thing that makes me embarrassed to like hockey.</p>\n<h3>#37: Chris Drury</h3>\n<p>Chris Drury was so rad in the 2001 Cup run. He was my favorite player, in that “good but not the biggest star on the team” way. Until 2022, I was sort of convinced that trading Drury in 2002 had cursed the Avalanche to never win another Cup.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">Runner-up:</span> J.T. Compher</p>\n<h3>#38: Matthew Barnaby</h3>\n<p>I mean, no one, really, but maybe Matt Barnaby a little? Should probably be Dave Andreychuk.</p>\n<h3>#39: T.J. Galiardi</h3>\n<p>Apologies to Pavel Francouz, who deserves this slot far more than Galiardi does.</p>\n<h3>#40: Alex Tanguay</h3>\n<p>Scoring two goals in Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final will make you pretty memorable. I could watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfJmtsxuU48\">this one</a> forever.</p>\n<p><span class=\"lead-in\">EDIT 2024-02-28:</span> Whoops, that one’s from Game 5 (says it right in the title), which the Avalanche lost 4–1. But still: slapshots on the rush are sweet.</p>\n<h3>#41: Craig Anderson</h3>\n<p>Anderson was in Colorado for one full season and part of another, but his Game 3 shutout of the Sharks in the 2010 quarterfinals—and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-06bXkPaQE\">crowd reaction to him being named first star</a>—was pretty memorable.</p>\n<h3>#42: Josh Manson</h3>\n<p>Not many #42’s to choose from, but Manson would be here anyway. Current player and a Cup winner in 2022.</p>\n<h3>#43: Darren Helm</h3>\n<p>Another chance to go with T.J. Galiardi. Or maybe Michael Sgarbossa. But <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9cPykH7cTw\">Helm’s series-winner against St. Louis</a> in 2022 is cast in bronze in my head.</p>\n<h3>#44: Ryan Wilson</h3>\n<p>Serviceable defensemen during the lean years.</p>\n<h3>#45: Jonathan Bernier</h3>\n<p>Backup goaltender in 2017–18. Got hurt in the playoffs.</p>\n<h3>#46: Stefan Elliott</h3>\n<p>One of two offensive defensemen (along with Tyson Barrie) who came up around the same time. I remember being more excited about Elliott than Barrie. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z7CnAaKF6U\">Scored his first NHL goal in his first NHL game</a>.</p>\n<h3>#47: No one</h3>\n<p>Alex Galchenyuk most recently. Otherwise it’s Dominic Toninato or Ray Macias.</p>\n<h3>#48: Scott Young</h3>\n<p>1996 Cup team</p>\n<h3>#49: Samuel Girard</h3>\n<p>2022 Cup team and current player. Hope he’s doing well.</p>\n<h3>#50: Ivan Prosvetov</h3>\n<p>Current back-up goaltender.</p>\n<h3>#51: Andrei Kovalenko</h3>\n<p>Just kidding. I have no memory of Kovalenko in the Avs uniform. He was part of the trade that brought Patrick Roy to Colorado.</p>\n<h3>#52: Adam Foote</h3>\n<p>Obviously.</p>\n<h3>#53: Derek Morris</h3>\n<p>The primary return in the Chris Drury trade, so of course I wasn’t a fan.</p>\n<h3>#54: David Jones</h3>\n<p>Scored a few goals during the lean years.</p>\n<h3>#55: Cody McLeod</h3>\n<p>The Highlander. Fan favorite.</p>\n<h3>#56: Kurtis MacDermid</h3>\n<p>Current player. 2022 Cup team.</p>\n<h3>#57: Gabriel Bourque</h3>\n<p>I don’t remember Bourque doing much of anything other than wearing #57.</p>\n<h3>#58: Patrick Bordeleau</h3>\n<p>Enforcer-type during the mid-2010s.</p>\n<h3>#59: Ben Meyers</h3>\n<p>Highly regarded college free agent signing who has yet to make a compelling case to stay in the NHL.</p>\n<h3>#60: José Théodore</h3>\n<p>A putative #1 goalie who was fine but not great as the Avs descended into mediocrity in the mid-aughts.</p>\n<h3>#61: Martin Kaut</h3>\n<p>Recent first-round pick who couldn’t crack the NHL roster and is now out of the league.</p>\n<h3>#62: Artturi Lehkonen</h3>\n<p>Trade-deadline acquisition in 2022. Scored the overtime goal in Game 4 of the Conference Finals to send the Avs to the Stanley Cup Final. Scored the game-winning (and eventual Cup-winning) goal in Game 6 if the Final. Pretty good.</p>\n<h3>#63: No one</h3>\n<p>No, I don’t remember Joel Prpic.</p>\n<h3>#64: Nail Yakupov</h3>\n<p>The only Avalanche player to ever wear 64. Former first overall draft pick with the Oilers. Didn’t stick around long.</p>\n<h3>#65–69: No one</h3>\n<p>Keaton Middleton wore #67 in 2021, and Cal Burke wore #68 for the two games he played in 2022–23. Neither are memorable.</p>\n<h3>#70: Sam Malinski</h3>\n<p>This would be another “no one” if not for the games Malinksi has played in the past few days.</p>\n<h3>#71: Patrice Brisebois</h3>\n<p>Longtime Montreal Canadiens defenseman. Played in Colorado for two seasons before going back to Montreal.</p>\n<h3>#72: Joonas Donskoi</h3>\n<p>Recent depth forward. Was only with the team for two seasons before being selected by Seattle in the expansion draft. Retired this season because of lingering post-concussion symptoms.</p>\n<h3>#73-76: No one</h3>\n<p>Sampo Ranta wore #75 in 2022–23, but didn’t stick in the NHL.</p>\n<h3>#77: Ray Bourque</h3>\n<p>Was a Boston Bruin for a millions years before being traded to Colorado to chase a Cup. Retired after they won in 2001.</p>\n<h3>#78: Nico Sturm</h3>\n<p>The only player to wear #78 for the Avalanche. 2022 trade-deadline acquisition. Assisted on a big goal in Game 4 of the Final.</p>\n<h3>#79 and #80: No one</h3>\n<p>No one’s ever worn these numbers for the Avalanche.</p>\n<h3>#81: Denis Malgin</h3>\n<p>Scored a few goals last season.</p>\n<h3>#82: Caleb Jones</h3>\n<p>The only #82 in Avs history. Has been playing recently with Girard out.</p>\n<h3>#83: Matt Nieto</h3>\n<p>Long Beach native. Nice bottom-six forward.</p>\n<h3>#84-86: No One</h3>\n<p>More unused numbers.</p>\n<h3>#87: Pierre Turgeon</h3>\n<p>This list is littered with big-ish names who came to Colorado toward the end of their careers: Iginla, Fleury, Beauchemin, Brisebois, Ray Bourque, Turgeon, Ryan Smyth (plus Paul Kariya and Teemu Salänne, who aren’t on this list). There’s been much less of that since the institution of the salary cap, but during the Pierre Lacroix days, you could pretty much bank on someone you’d heard of signing in the offseason or arriving via trade toward the end of the season to play for a chance at the Cup.</p>\n<h3>#88: Peter Mueller</h3>\n<p>Looked good in Arizona in the late aughts. Traded to Colorado for Wojtek Wolski in 2010, and played well before sustaining a concussion on a hit from Rob Blake.</p>\n<h3>#89: Mikkel Bødker</h3>\n<p>The only option for #89. Trade-deadline rental in 2016.</p>\n<h3>#90: Ryan O’Reilly</h3>\n<p>Seemed like he was going to be a big part of the next good Avalanche team, but a series of contract disputes soured his relationship with the team. He was traded to Buffalo for J.T. Compher and Nikita Zadorov.</p>\n<h3>#91: Nazem Kadri</h3>\n<p>Was in many ways the missing piece that pushed the Avs from contenders to Cup winners. Had a terrific playoffs in 2022.</p>\n<h3>#92: Gabriel Landeskog</h3>\n<p>Was named captain after his rookie season and has been the soul of the team since. A knee injury has kept him from playing since Game 6 of the Final in 2022.</p>\n<h3>#93: No one</h3>\n<h3>#94: Ryan Smyth</h3>\n<p>Longtime Oiler who bounced around a bit toward the end of his career. Actually tied (with Milan Hejduk) for the team lead in scoring in 2008–09.</p>\n<h3>#95: André Burakovsky</h3>\n<p>Key secondary scoring during the 2022 Cup run (and the two seasons prior).</p>\n<h3>#96: Mikko Rantanen</h3>\n<p>2022 Cup winner and current top-line winger. A wizard when it comes to awkward-looking one-timers. Now I have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1D1l7mdgU8\">this song</a> stuck in my head.</p>\n<h3>#97 and #98: No one</h3>\n<h3>#99: No one</h3>\n<p>Wayne Gretzky’s #99 is retired league-wide.</p>\n",

I made two bowls, a platter, a bottle stopper, a desk shelf, an end table, and a small cabinet.</p>\n<p>The classes were good introductions to the techniques and equipment involved in turning large pieces of wood into smaller, fancier pieces of wood. I learned how to use a table saw and a lathe and a chisel. But I don’t think I’ve done enough that I could walk into a shop and make something out of raw lumber without a lot of guidance. Kinda feels like cooking: I know enough to follow a recipe, but not enough to improvise in the kitchen.</p>\n<p>I’d like to do more woodworking, to get more practice with the tools, and eventually make useful things (I have ideas for a built-in desk/drawers/shelves thing). But it won’t make sense to buy my own equipment or to pay for one-on-one instruction at a shop until I have a relatively permanent place to put things. Time to buy a house.</p>\n",

      "title": "The 2022–23 Colorado Avalanche",
      "content_html": "<p>I’m writing this the day after the Colorado Avalanche lost Game 5 of their first-round playoff series against the Seattle Kraken, and the day before they face elimination in Game 6.</p>\n<p>I care about hockey more than any other sport, which makes it less fun to pay attention to. Playoff hockey can be dramatic, tense, and fun, but it’s also stressful to watch, especially when your favorite team is on the wrong side of the drama. As much as I’d prefer to see the Avalanche repeat as Stanley Cup champions, I’m ready for their season to end tomorrow.</p>\n<p>It’s been a weird season. Team captain Gabe Landeskog has missed the entire season and won’t play in these playoffs. Several key depth players from last season departed in free agency, and the team has struggled to replace their offensive production. The team underperformed for significant portions of the regular season, but ended up winning the division. Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen both scored more than 100 points, setting career highs in the process. Alexandar Georgiev demonstrated he can be a very capable number-one goaltender.</p>\n<p>The playoffs have been weird, too. Colorado was generally expected to roll over the Seattle, though perhaps not dominate them. Instead, the Kraken have scored first in every game and done a fair job neutralizing the Avalanche’s top-heavy lineup. Key depth winger Valeri Nichushkin has been away from the team for personal reasons since after Game 2. Mild-mannered star defensemen Cale Makar was suspended for Game 5 after throwing a late hit in Game 4 that injured (and likely concussed) Kraken 40-goal scorer Jared McCann, a hit that made Makar the subject of much ire on Reddit that night. And though the Avalanche have demonstrated the ability to come back and even pull away from the Kraken, they’ve more often than not struggled to find the rhythm and pace that made them so successful in last year’s playoffs.</p>\n<p>Sports fandom as identity is fraught. The Avalanche represent my home state, and won the Stanley Cup their first season in Denver. If I’m going to be a fan of any hockey team, it makes sense for it to be the Avalanche. But becoming too invested in the performance, reputation, and actions of a bunch of people almost half my age is perilous. I like Cale Makar quite a bit. He’s highly skilled but not demonstrative. He can be physical but isn’t a goon. He plays hockey the way I like to see hockey played, the way I would want to play: with skill and precision instead of force. So seeing him make an unjustifiably poor decision on the McCann hit is more than a little disappointing. Not only did he remove himself from Game 5 (an important game his team ended up losing), he also handed people an angle from which to be critical of him—to be critical of something/someone I really like.</p>\n<p>That’s a bummer, and it makes me pause for a second before putting on an Avalanche shirt in the morning, as if by wearing the shirt I’m aligning myself with the most negative aspects of this thing I like in addition to the most positive.</p>\n<p>It would be remarkable if the Avalanche were able to turn things around, win this series with the Kraken, then roll with that momentum through the rest of the playoffs. Stuff like that has happened before. But it’s so unlikely that part of me would rather see the Kraken win tomorrow, at home in front of their fans. It would be a great story for them, and would allow me to relax and have fun watching the rest of the playoffs.</p>\n",

      "content_html": "<p>I complained to S. yesterday that our lawn was looking rough. Mowing now would be a disservice to the pollinators that are enjoying the deadnettle, so she suggested I could express my desire for order by working to remove the volunteer green onions. These onions grow in clumps, and create long green manes of savory-smelling “grass”.</p>\n<p>She’d seen advice recently that the best way to get rid of these onions was to use a spade to cut down and under them, pull the layer of soil back to expose the bulbs, then pull each onion by its bulb “down” through the soil. Sort of like hair plugs in reverse. I don’t really know anything about hair plugs.</p>\n<p>I worked on a couple small patches for maybe 45 minutes, ended up with a pile of tiny white bulbs and long green … stems? … and made pretty much zero difference in the aesthetics of our lawn.</p>\n<p>S. observed that men aren’t interested in weeding, only in mowing, and I guess that’s true in my case. I have very little enthusiasm for gardening, and only slightly more for lawn care. My primary interest in mowing the lawn is making it look tidy, a goal that’s often in direct opposition to S.'s. I don’t need the lawn to be a sterile monoculture of Bermuda grass or whatever, but a part of me <em>does</em> need my stuff to present an acceptable face to the world, to look intentional.</p>\n<p>I might come back to the Onion Project, if only to work on my gardening muscles a little bit. The onion bulbs, packed together as they are, remind me of spider eggs, which kinda grosses me out.</p>\n",
