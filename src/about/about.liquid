Cedeless is the personal project site of Reuben Dalke. That's me. Hi.

This isn't a [résumé site](https://reubendalke.com/resume/), but it exists in public largely to demonstrate my ability to build web pages. If I didn't need to appeal to potential employers, all this stuff would be running on `localhost`.

## Who do you think you are, [putting on such airs](https://achewood.com/2004/02/18/title.html)?

I'm a human who appreciates video games, peanut butter, and websites that let the back button do its job. I like watching ice hockey, but it stresses me out. I go for long walks, during which I concoct new things to worry about and try to let go of old ones. I like to read, mainly fiction.

I don't do social media, so this is where I exist online. If you want to talk, you can [send me email](mailto:mail@cedeless.com).

## OK, but 'cedeless'?

As origin stories go, this one is pedestrian: I bought a bag of seedless lemons once that was labeled in both English and French. I saw the C in _citrons_ out of the corner of my eye and thought for a moment they'd somehow misspelled "seedless". "Ceedless" led to "cedeless", and within an hour I was registering a domain name.

I like this kind of homonym play. It's not _funny_, exactly, but I think it's fun. "Cedeless" doesn't really mean anything.

Except...

I do think "cede less" kind of describes my approach to personal projects. I don't like shortcuts. I don't like frameworks. I want to make things myself, without relying too much on someone else's work.

I'm not writing my own web server, and I'm unlikely to, say, fell a tree myself for a woodworking project. I'm not inventing the universe so I can make an apple pie. But, when practical, I'm going to roll my own stuff rather than implement someone else's. I want to cede less control of my projects to platforms, services, and packages.

## What is Infinite, Worthless Time?

[Infinite, Worthless Time](/iwt/) is a blog. There's not a ton I want to share with the internet, but what I do have is there.

Blogs and content sites are good personal web development projects, because they encourage you to build a system that can gracefully handle arbitrary input. Did you handle the case where a post starts with a `ul`? Does your pagination scheme make sense when there are only five posts? It's more interesting than a static brochure site, even if the content is [less than profound](/iwt/2023/11/29/avalanche-numbers/).

## What is Shelf?

[Shelf](/shelf/) is a tool for keeping track of my video game library. I have an Airtable base that performs this function admirably, but I wanted to try my hand at creating something on my own.

Shelf is a simple table with [a surprising degree of underlying complexity](https://github.com/dalke/Cedeless/blob/main/shelf.html). I have plans to make it more than that, but progress is slow.

Keeping track of my games is something [I think about a lot](shelf/).

## So did Copilot make all this or what?

Nope. I did not use any large-language-model tools in the development of this site, at least not directly or intentionally.

## A colophon of sorts

This site is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

I'm using Matthew Butterick's [Valkyrie](https://mbtype.com/fonts/valkyrie/) and [Triplicate](https://mbtype.com/fonts/triplicate/) typefaces.

Some colors are derived from [these Dieter Rams palettes](https://www.presentandcorrect.com/blogs/blog/rams-palette) collected by Chad Ashley.
