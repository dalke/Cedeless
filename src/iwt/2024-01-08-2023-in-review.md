- The Talos Principle (2014) (In progress)
- SteamWorld Build (2023)
- Chants of Sennaar (2023)
- Dave the Diver (2023) (In progress)

Tears of the Kingdom is probably my game of the year (of the 2023 games I played _in_ 2023). I spent about 300 hours on it over three months. It's a very solid second pass on Breath of the Wild: same map, better abilities, _much_ better dungeons, a bunch more clever shrines.

Hi-Fi Rush, Cocoon, Mario Wonder, and Chants of Sennaar are also great. Terra Nil and SteamWorld Build are good. I probably would have liked Dave the Diver more if I hadn't played it while sick and feverish.

Burning Shores didn't bring anything new to Horizon except some additional story that I found unexpectedly touching. Tinykin was probably my favorite "old" game I played this year, excluding all-time favorites like Link to the Past and Burnout Paradise.

### Books

- _Master of Furies_ (The Firemane Saga #3), by Raymond E. Feist
- _Sea of Tranquility_, by Emily St. John Mandel
- _The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet_ (Wayfarers #1), by Becky Chambers
- _A Closed and Common Orbit_ (Wayfarers #2), by Becky Chambers
- _Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow_, by Gabrielle Zevin
- _Stories of Your Life and Others_, by Ted Chiang
- _The Glass Hotel_, by Emily St. John Mandel
- _Heat 2_, Michael Mann & Meg Gardiner
- _Record of a Spaceborn Few_ (Wayfarers #3), by Becky Chambers
- _The Galaxy, and the Ground Within_ (Wayfarers #4), by Becky Chambers
- _The End of Everything_, by Katie Mack
- _Wool_ (Silo #1), by Hugh Howey

I tried to read more this year, but this list looks pretty sad compared to the ones above and below it. Becky Chambers' Wayfarers books were my favorites of the year. Tough to pick one of them over the others, so I won't.

I blazed through the MCU's Infinity Saga in November. There's some fun stuff in there, and I can see why people enjoyed it so much. Of the stuff I hadn't seen, I think the end of Infinity War hit me the hardest.

Other than that I was mostly watching or _rewatching_ mindless stuff while riding a stationary bike. Oppenheimer was my favorite movie of the the year by default. I liked it well enough.

### TV

- Reservations Dogs (S1 and S2)
- Star Trek: Deep Space Nine
- For All Mankind (S1-3)
- Dead to Me
- Only Murders in the Building (S1 and S2)
- Russian Doll (S2)
- Brooklyn 99
- Ted Lasso (S3)
- I Am Groot
- What We Do in the Shadows (S5)
- Reservation Dogs (S3)
- Loki
- Only Murders in the Building (S3)

Reservation Dogs was great. Loki sagged in spots but was overall pretty good.
