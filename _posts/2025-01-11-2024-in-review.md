As I did the previous year, I spent _several hours_ in 2024 consuming media, and several more hours walking around thinking about consuming media.

Kind of a down year for me, games-wise. I started a few things but didn't finish much. Super Mario RPG, Destiny, Boltgun, PowerWash Simulator, and Vampire Survivors are all in some form of deep stasis, waiting for me to come back to DLC or overcome a stuck-in-the-mud absence of inertia. DRG: Survivor and Hades II are both really good as-is but still in early access, and I'm inclined to wait until they're properly released to go back to them. Terra Nil was a short but satisfying exercise in putting a ruined world back together. The Talos Principle was great, and this in-game description of the titular idea has been in my thoughts a lot recently:

>It's this old philosophical concept about the impossibility of avoiding reality—no matter what you believe, if you lose your blood, you will die. I think that applies to our situation more than we'd like to admit.

Grounded is the most fun I've had with a tree-punching game, and Children of the Sun was a weird sniping/puzzle game that knew when to call it a day. Echoes of Wisdom was a neat idea that mostly failed to make any sort of lasting impression on me.

I've put more than 200 hours into Satisfactory, mostly designing, building, and disassembling _systems_ rather than producing parts. It's really good, but at this pace I'll be playing it for the rest of my life.

I avoided the Murderbot books for a long time because I misunderstood their tone. "Murderbot" makes me think of GLaDOS and that whole genre of aughts-era humorously malicious machine, but Martha Well's books are way more nuanced and emotionally complex than that. There's violence, but Wells describes it sparingly and doesn't luxuriate in it the way some other writers would. I loved the whole series.

Elsewhere: Ted Chiang's short stories are great (see yet another rewatch of Arrival below); I want to own a print version of _Time War_ so I can highlight all the great wordplay; magical realism (_Wind-Up Bird_) doesn't always hit; I'm enjoying Adrian Tchaikovsky's Final Architecture books.

I continued to traverse the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2024, but the stuff that stuck with me is in the next section. I saw Dune 2 and Furiosa in the theater and enjoyed both. The Lord of the Rings movies were such meme factories that they're difficult to take seriously today. I thought I'd missed more of the Mission: Impossible movies than I had, and I don't ever need to see #2 again. I still love Arrival. M\*A\*S\*H was a weird waste of time.
